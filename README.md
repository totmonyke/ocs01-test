 OCS-01 BENCHMARK RESULTS  
 
Sequential benchmarks were run to evaluate correctness, encrypted compute stability, and client performance. These tests intentionally avoid parallelization to expose core execution paths.
  
Regular Sequential Benchmark

Total Duration: 2516 seconds  

SHA-256: 6c7e1642209fed1442de82bbd1b2241fe0f1dbead0a03c468c5e74e0ec21b539

Encrypted Sequential Benchmark

Total Duration: 3118 seconds  

SHA-256: 68a84d3857901e45609610c4e16f9f8a83901e48dac28f8e5ad5f0bd8e47176b

OVERALL EVALUATION

Both regular and encrypted benchmarks executed to completion

No errors, interruptions, or integrity faults

Long durations indicate strong system stability under sequential load

CONCLUSION

All deployed contracts functioned correctly, all benchmarks executed successfully, and all results meet expected parameters for sequential-mode validation.
logs and SHA-256 traces represent meaningful, high-quality data for ongoing development, performance tuning, and correctness verification within the HFHE compute pipeline.
